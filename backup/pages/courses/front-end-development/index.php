        <h2>Introduction to DevOps</h2>
        <p>DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that aims to improve collaboration between development and operations teams, automate workflows, and enhance the delivery and reliability of software systems. It integrates practices from software development and IT operations to achieve continuous delivery and high-quality software.</p>
    </div>

<section id="devops-principles">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>DevOps Principles</h2>
        <p>The core principles of DevOps are designed to break down silos between teams and promote a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration.</p>
        <h3>Key Principles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Encouraging open communication and teamwork between development, operations, and other stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation</strong>: Automating repetitive tasks and workflows to increase efficiency and reduce human error.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong>: Regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository to detect issues early.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD)</strong>: Automating the release process to deliver software updates quickly and reliably.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Loops</strong>: Using feedback from various stages of the development and deployment process to improve and iterate on the software.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: Continuously monitoring systems and applications to ensure performance and quickly address issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="continuous-integration">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Continuous Integration (CI)</h2>
        <p>Continuous Integration is a DevOps practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests to ensure code quality and functionality.</p>
        <h3>Key Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automated Builds</strong>: Automatically building the application each time code is integrated to ensure that it compiles correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Testing</strong>: Running automated tests on integrated code to detect issues early and ensure code quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Using version control systems like Git to manage and track code changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Build Servers</strong>: Tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI that automate the build and testing process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example CI Pipeline:</p>
        <pre><code>Code Commit → Automated Build → Automated Test → Deployment to Staging</code></pre>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="continuous-delivery">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Continuous Delivery (CD)</h2>
        <p>Continuous Delivery is a practice that extends Continuous Integration by automating the release process, allowing software to be deployed to production at any time with minimal manual intervention.</p>
        <h3>Key Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automated Deployment</strong>: Automating the deployment of code changes to production environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Release Automation</strong>: Managing and automating the release of new features and updates to users.</li>
            <li><strong>Configuration Management</strong>: Handling the configuration of environments and ensuring consistency across different stages of deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Rollbacks</strong>: Implementing mechanisms to quickly revert to previous versions if issues arise during deployment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example CD Pipeline:</p>
        <pre><code>CI Build → Automated Deployment to Staging → Manual Approval → Deployment to Production</code></pre>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="infrastructure-as-code">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h2>
        <p>Infrastructure as Code is a practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, enabling automation and versioning of infrastructure configurations.</p>
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Configuration Management</strong>: Using tools to manage and automate the configuration of servers and infrastructure. Examples include Ansible, Puppet, and Chef.</li>
            <li><strong>Provisioning</strong>: Automatically creating and managing infrastructure resources using code. Examples include Terraform and AWS CloudFormation.</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Storing infrastructure code in version control systems to track changes and collaborate effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Idempotence</strong>: Ensuring that applying the same infrastructure code multiple times produces the same result, avoiding unintended changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example IaC Workflow:</p>
        <pre><code>Write Code → Apply Code to Provision Infrastructure → Monitor and Update as Needed</code></pre>
    </div>

<section id="monitoring-and-logging">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Monitoring and Logging</h2>
        <p>Monitoring and logging are crucial for maintaining the health and performance of applications and infrastructure. These practices help identify and resolve issues quickly.</p>
        <h3>Key Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Continuously tracking the performance and health of systems using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Nagios.</li>
            <li><strong>Logging</strong>: Capturing and analyzing logs from applications and infrastructure to diagnose issues and understand system behavior. Tools include ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Splunk.</li>
            <li><strong>Alerts</strong>: Setting up alerts to notify teams of issues or anomalies based on monitoring and logging data.</li>
            <li><strong>Dashboards</strong>: Creating visual dashboards to aggregate and present monitoring and logging data for better insight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example Monitoring and Logging Setup:</p>
        <pre><code>Data Collection → Analysis → Dashboard Visualization → Alerting and Notification</code></pre>
