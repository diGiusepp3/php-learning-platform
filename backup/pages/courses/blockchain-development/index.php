        <h2>Introduction to Blockchain Development</h2>
        <p>Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. It ensures transparency, security, and immutability, making it suitable for various applications beyond cryptocurrencies. This course will cover the fundamentals of blockchain technology, how to develop smart contracts, and create decentralized applications (DApps).</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Blockchain Basics</h2>
        <p>A blockchain is a chain of blocks where each block contains a list of transactions. The key features of a blockchain include decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic security.</p>
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: No central authority controls the blockchain; it is maintained by a network of nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Blocks</strong>: Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block.</li>
            <li><strong>Consensus Mechanisms</strong>: Methods used to agree on the validity of transactions, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptographic Hash Functions</strong>: Functions like SHA-256 ensure the integrity and security of data within the blockchain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example Block Structure:</p>
        <pre><code>Block {
    Header: {
        Previous Block Hash,
        Timestamp,
        Nonce
    },
    Body: {
        Transactions
    }
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

<section id="smart-contracts">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Smart Contracts</h2>
        <p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on blockchain platforms and automatically enforce and execute the terms of a contract when predefined conditions are met.</p>
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Smart contracts are scripts that are deployed and executed on a blockchain platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Platforms</strong>: Ethereum is the most widely used platform for creating smart contracts. Other platforms include Binance Smart Chain and Cardano.</li>
            <li><strong>Development</strong>: Smart contracts are typically written in languages such as Solidity (for Ethereum) and Plutus (for Cardano).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example Solidity Smart Contract:</p>
        <pre><code>pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint public storedData;

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

<section id="cryptocurrencies">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. They operate on blockchain technology and are decentralized.</p>
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bitcoin</strong>: The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, created by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto.</li>
            <li><strong>Altcoins</strong>: Alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin, including Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.</li>
            <li><strong>Wallets</strong>: Digital tools for storing and managing cryptocurrencies. Examples include hardware wallets and software wallets.</li>
            <li><strong>Exchanges</strong>: Platforms for buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrencies, such as Coinbase and Binance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example Bitcoin Transaction:</p>
        <pre><code>Transaction {
    Sender: "1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa",
    Receiver: "1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4G2o8wV5HJ8A",
    Amount: 0.1 BTC

<section id="blockchain-platforms">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Blockchain Platforms</h2>
        <p>Several platforms enable the development of blockchain applications and smart contracts. Each platform has its own unique features and capabilities.</p>
        <h3>Popular Blockchain Platforms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ethereum</strong>: A decentralized platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and DApps.</li>
            <li><strong>Hyperledger</strong>: A collaborative project that offers open-source tools and frameworks for enterprise blockchain solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Binance Smart Chain</strong>: A blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts with low fees and fast transactions.</li>
