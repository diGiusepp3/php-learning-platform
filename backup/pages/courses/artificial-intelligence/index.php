        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning is a core component of AI that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data. It is broadly categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.</p>
        <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: The model is trained on labeled data. Examples include regression and classification tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: The model identifies patterns and structures in unlabeled data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Creating a model
model = LinearRegression()

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
</code></pre>

<section id="deep-learning">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>Deep Learning involves neural networks with multiple layers that enable the model to learn from vast amounts of data. It is especially effective for complex tasks such as image and speech recognition.</p>
        <h3>Key Deep Learning Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neural Networks</strong>: Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data and produce outputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>: Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong>: Designed for sequential data such as time series or natural language.</li>
            <li><strong>Backpropagation</strong>: The algorithm used to train neural networks by minimizing the error between predicted and actual outputs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Creating a model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI focused on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves tasks such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and language translation.</p>
        <h3>Key NLP Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: Breaking down text into individual words or phrases.</li>
            <li><strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</strong>: Identifying and classifying key elements in text such as names, dates, and locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>: Determining the sentiment expressed in text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Translation</strong>: Automatically translating text from one language to another.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>from transformers import pipeline

# Creating a sentiment analysis pipeline
nlp = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

# Analyzing sentiment
result = nlp("I love learning new things!")
print(result)
