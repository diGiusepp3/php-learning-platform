    <div class="container">
        <h2>Cloud Computing Basics</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing provides various services like storage, processing, and applications over the internet. It eliminates the need for local servers and hardware, offering flexible and scalable solutions.</p>
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Ability to easily scale resources up or down based on demand.</li>
            <li><strong>On-Demand Self-Service</strong>: Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Pooling</strong>: Resources are pooled to serve multiple customers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned according to demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Measured Service</strong>: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging metering capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example Cloud Service Diagram:</p>
        <pre><code>Client → Cloud Service Provider → Services (Compute, Storage, etc.)</code></pre>
    </div>

<section id="service-models">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Cloud Service Models</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing services are categorized into different models based on the level of control and management provided to the user.</p>
        <h3>Key Service Models</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong>: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples include AWS EC2 and Microsoft Azure VMs.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong>: Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. Examples include Google App Engine and Heroku.</li>
            <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong>: Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Examples include Google Workspace and Salesforce.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example Service Model Diagram:</p>
        <pre><code>IaaS: Virtual Machines, Storage
PaaS: Development Frameworks, Databases
SaaS: Applications, Software Tools
</code></pre>

<section id="deployment-models">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Cloud Deployment Models</h2>
        <p>Deployment models define how cloud resources are made available to users and organizations.</p>
        <h3>Key Deployment Models</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Cloud</strong>: Services are offered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations. Examples include AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Cloud</strong>: Services are maintained on a private network, dedicated to a single organization. Offers greater control and security.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud</strong>: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Offers greater flexibility and optimized existing infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Cloud</strong>: Shared infrastructure for a specific community with common concerns (e.g., security, compliance). Managed by one or more organizations or a third party.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<section id="key-providers">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Key Cloud Providers</h2>
        <p>Several major cloud providers offer a range of cloud computing services, each with its own strengths and features.</p>
        <h3>Popular Cloud Providers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>: The largest and most widely used cloud provider, offering a broad set of cloud services and tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>: A comprehensive cloud platform offering various services, including computing, analytics, storage, and networking.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong>: Provides cloud computing services including computing, data storage, and machine learning.</li>

<section id="cloud-architecture">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Cloud Architecture</h2>
        <p>Cloud architecture involves the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing, including front-end and back-end systems, as well as the cloud infrastructure itself.</p>
        <h3>Key Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front-End</strong>: The user interface and the application used to interact with cloud services.</li>
            <li><strong>Back-End</strong>: The cloud servers, databases, and other components that deliver the service.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure</strong>: The physical hardware and virtualized resources used to deliver cloud services, such as servers, storage, and networking.</li>
            <li><strong>Middleware</strong>: Software that connects the front-end and back-end, enabling communication and data management.</li>
