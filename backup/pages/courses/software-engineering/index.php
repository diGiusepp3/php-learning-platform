    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction to Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>Software Engineering is a field that applies engineering principles to software development. It involves systematic approaches to the design, development, and maintenance of software systems to ensure they meet specified requirements and are of high quality.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="software-engineering-process">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Software Engineering Process</h2>
        <p>The software engineering process consists of several stages that guide the development of software systems. These stages help in managing complexity, ensuring quality, and meeting user requirements.</p>
        <h3>Key Stages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requirements Analysis:</strong> Understanding and documenting what the software should do.</li>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Creating a blueprint for the software, including architecture and interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Writing the code and integrating different components.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Verifying that the software works as intended and fixing any issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Updating and improving the software after deployment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="requirements-analysis">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Requirements Analysis</h2>
        <p>Requirements analysis is the process of determining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. This stage involves gathering, documenting, and analyzing requirements to create a clear specification for the software.</p>
        <h3>Key Activities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> Conducting interviews with users and other stakeholders to gather requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Requirement Elicitation:</strong> Identifying and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Requirement Specification:</strong> Creating detailed requirement specifications that serve as a foundation for design and development.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="design">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The design phase involves creating a detailed blueprint for the software system. This includes defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and data structures.</p>
        <h3>Design Principles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Breaking down the system into manageable and independent modules.</li>
            <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Designing components that can be reused in different parts of the system or in other projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Ensuring the system can handle growth in users, data, and functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Design Example:</p>
        <pre><code># Example of a simple class diagram
class User {
    +userID: int
    +username: string
    +email: string
    +login(): void
}
</code></pre>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="implementation">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Implementation is the stage where the software design is translated into code. This phase involves writing, debugging, and integrating code to build the software system.</p>
        <h3>Key Activities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code Writing:</strong> Writing code according to the design specifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Combining different modules and components to form a complete system.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Identifying and fixing bugs and issues in the code.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="testing">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>Testing is the process of evaluating the software to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. This stage involves executing test cases, identifying defects, and verifying that issues are resolved.</p>
        <h3>Testing Types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual components or units of the software.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Testing the interactions between different components.</li>
            <li><strong>System Testing:</strong> Testing the complete system to ensure it meets the requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>User Acceptance Testing:</strong> Testing the software with end-users to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="maintenance">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Maintenance involves making updates and improvements to the software after it has been deployed. This includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and adapting to changing requirements.</p>
        <h3>Maintenance Activities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Resolving defects and issues reported by users.</li>
